Model Reg - the voluntary RC model registry
===========================================

We're some guys form Switzerland thinking about building some useful measure to
counter the "Drone hate" and over-reaching regulation fantasies that are
currently going on in some of our governments.

Here's a rough outline of what we're trying to build:

* A web application where people can register themselves (voluntarily, address
  verification via physical letter)
* Ability to print out a sheet with QR codes to stick to your model
  (potentially as-a-service for a small fee)
* The data will be fully encrypted. Part of the QR code URL would be a random
  key to decrypt part of your information (for example phone number and name)
* Access via QR code will also give you the ability to notify the owner if you
  found a model

This will be targeted towards recular RC clubs / plane owners, RC drone and
racing clubs etc, as they do have similar requirements/problems.

The goal is to show to the government bodies that there is already a system in
place that satisfies their *actual* requirements of criminal prosecution IF
something happens and give a reasonable alternative to the transponder idea
that DJI recently proposed (some of the guys in our civil aviation government
body are playing with that idea as well)

We're explicitly trying to build this as free software, so clubs all over the
world could run this themselves if they want.

So - what's your take on this? Do you see any obvious flaws or things that we
would HAVE to include to make this actually useful?
